# Configure the file manager to queue uploaded files when the "start" flag
# is set and Klipper cannot immediately start the print.
[file_manager]
queue_gcode_uploads: True
enable_object_processing: True

# Configure the Job Queue to start a queued print when Klipper reports as
# ready.
[job_queue]
load_on_startup: True
# Configure the job_transition_delay and job_transition_gcode options
# if desired.  Note that they do no apply to prints loaded on startup.

[power swx2_outlet]
type: homeassistant
#   The type of device.  Can be either gpio, klipper_device, rf,
#   tplink_smartplug, tasmota, shelly, homeseer, homeassistant, loxonev1,
#   smartthings, mqtt or hue.
#   This parameter must be provided.
address: 192.168.0.202
#   A valid ip address or hostname for the Home Assistant server.  This
#   parameter must be provided.
protocol: http
#   The protocol for the URL to the Home Assistant server. Default is http.
port: 8123
#   The port the Home Assistant server is listening on.  Default is 8123.
device: switch.outlet_swx2
#   The entity ID of the switch to control. This parameter must be provided.
token: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiIxNzJjOWI2ZjI0YTA0NTM0YWIyYTViYWEzZTRmYjZkOCIsImlhdCI6MTY4NTMwMDM0NywiZXhwIjoyMDAwNjYwMzQ3fQ.kL3rH5-hWpniahEk14yNV3COzCrp-AEEMbUQF2ngJos
#   A token used for request authorization.  This option accepts
#   Jinja2 Templates, see the [secrets] section for details. This parameter
#   must be provided.
domain: switch
#   The class of device managed by Home Assistant. Default is "switch".
status_delay: 1.0
#   The time (in seconds) to delay between requesting a device to turn
#   on/off and requesting its current status.  This is a workaround used
#   to validate that Home Assistant has successfully toggled the device,
#   as the API is currently broken on their end.  Default is 1 second.
#
off_when_shutdown: True
#   If set to True the device will be powered off when Klipper enters
#   the "shutdown" state.  This option applies to all device types.
#   The default is False.
off_when_shutdown_delay: 30
#   If "off_when_shutdown" is set, this option specifies the amount of time
#   (in seconds) to wait before turning the device off. Default is 0 seconds.
on_when_job_queued: True
#   If set to True the device will power on if a job is queued while the
#   device is off.  This allows for an automated "upload, power on, and
#   print" approach directly from the slicer, see the configuration example
#   below for details. The default is False.
locked_while_printing: True
#   If True, locks the device so that the power cannot be changed while the
#   printer is printing. This is useful to avert an accidental shutdown to
#   the printer's power.  The default is False.
restart_klipper_when_powered: True
#   If set to True, Moonraker will schedule a "FIRMWARE_RESTART" to command
#   after the device has been powered on. If it isn't possible to immediately
#   schedule a firmware restart (ie: Klippy is disconnected), the restart
#   will be postponed until Klippy reconnects and reports that startup is
#   complete.  Prior to scheduling the restart command the power device will
#   always check Klippy's state.  If Klippy reports that it is "ready", the
#   FIRMWARE_RESTART will be aborted as unnecessary.
#   The default is False.
restart_delay: 5.
#   If "restart_klipper_when_powered" is set, this option specifies the amount
#   of time (in seconds) to delay the restart.  Default is 1 second.
bound_services:
#   A newline separated list of services that are "bound" to the state of this
#   device.  When the device is powered on all bound services will be started.
#   When the device is powered off all bound services are stopped.
#
#   The items in this list are limited to those specified in the allow list,
#   see the [machine] configuration documentation for details.  Additionally,
#   the Moonraker service can not be bound to a power device.  Note that
#   service names are case sensitive.
#
#   The default is no services are bound to the device
